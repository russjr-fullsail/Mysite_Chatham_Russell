	 <h3>About the build</h3>
	 <p>So I purchased the 2007 Jeep Rubicon Unlimited on July 4th 2010.  This was my big purchase after I found out I was going to be a father.  My original plan was to keep it stock.  That didn't last long.  I met up with some local Jeep owners and got talking.  Next thing I know I am in a Jeep club and going off wheeling.  The jeep stayed stock for the summer.  Once fall bagan so did the upgrades.  I started off by adding a Rough Country 3.5" suspension lift.  This gave the Jeep a nice height but still lacked the bad attitude look.<p>

	 <h1>The Project Continues....</h1>
	 <div id="project">
	 <p>As you can see by the list above, I have spent a lot of time working on my Jeep.  Just recently I replaced all the shocks.  I also went and ordered new chromoly axle shafts for it.  My list grows every time I go out wheeling.  I see something that I like that someone else did and decide if I want to do that to.  Part of owning a Jeep though is the friends you make.  Nothing like hanging out near a campfire swapping stories of where you have been, what you have done and what you plan to do next.  Some other accessories on my Jeep is lots of lights.  These lights though are not off-road lights.  The lights are Red and White warning lights.  I am an Assistant Fire Chief and in New York State we have the authority to run the same warning lights as Police do.  Talk about a unique and expensive set of lights.  All the lights on it was custom ordered for my Jeep.  In future updates to the website I will add video of the Jeep at night with all the warning lights on.</p>   When you own a Jeep you quickly learn what the name Jeep stands for:<aside><span><strong>"Just Empty Every Pocket!"</strong></span></aside>
	 <p>When I am working on my Jeep, I find it relaxing and fun.  I take a lot of pride in what I have built.  Some of my friends think I spend too much time modifying it, but like I said it is something I enjoy.</p>
	 <p>My passion for building my Jeep has led to one small problem.  I have a 29 month old son, he is just as crazy about Jeeps as I am.  Where ever we go, if he sees a Jeep he is quick to say "Jeep Jeep".  Just recently my wife and I got him the Fisher Price Jeep Hurricane.  Needless to say he jumped right in it and took off.  Now he wants stickers like "Daddies Jeep" on his Jeep.  It is so much fun having him outside with me when I am working on the Jeep, he wants to see everything I am doing.  Then he will go over to his Jeep and open to hood and check it out.</p>
